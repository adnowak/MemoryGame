# memoryGame
A game made to improve your memory

That's the first project in which i used objective programming, at least i thought so then ;).

It's a game in which you are presented a set of baloons on the sky with certain position.

Your task is to remember their position, then they disappear. When they come back, they're in the same position as before, but there's an additional one. You have to click on that one.

The game counts your points, which you get by clicking on the new baloon, each 3 of them put you into the next level of difficulty, when you lose your points, you go back to the lower level.
